# Stroke-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of stroke among patients using their medical data. The dataset used in this study contains 5110 records of patients, each with 12 columns representing specific attributes.By analyzing this data and applying machine learning techniques, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify patients at higher risk of stroke based on their medical profiles.
